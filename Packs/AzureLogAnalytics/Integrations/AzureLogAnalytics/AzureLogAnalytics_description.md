Log Analytics is a service that helps you collect and analyze data generated by resources in your cloud and on-premises environments.

Full documentation for this integration is available in the [reference docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/azure-log-analytics).


## Authorize Cortex XSOAR for Azure Log Analytics

You need to grant Cortex XSOAR authorization to access Azure Log Analytics.

1. Access the [authorization flow](https://oproxy.demisto.ninja/ms-azure-log-analytics). 
2. Click the **Start Authorization Process** button, and you will be prompted to grant Cortex XSOAR permissions for your Azure Service Management. 
3. Click the **Accept** button, and you will receive your ID, token, and key. You will need to enter these when you configure the Azure Log Analytics integration instance in Cortex XSOAR.

## Authorize Cortex XSOAR for Azure Log Analytics (self-deployed configuration)
To use a self-configured Azure application, you need to add a new Azure App Registration in the Azure Portal. To add the registration, refer to the following [Microsoft article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

### Required permissions
- Azure Service Management - permission `user_impersonation` of type `Delegated`
- Log Analytics API - permission `Data.Read` of type `Delegated`

There are two flows to authenticate in self-deployed mode
1. Authentication code flow.
2. Client Credentials flow.

### Authentication Code flow

---
1. Copy the following URL and replace the ***CLIENT_ID*** and ***REDIRECT_URI*** with your own client ID and redirect URI, accordingly.
```https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&resource=https://management.core.windows.net&client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI```
2. Enter the link and you will be prompted to grant Cortex XSOAR permissions for your Azure Service Management. You will be automatically redirected to a link with the following structure:
```REDIRECT_URI?code=AUTH_CODE&session_state=SESSION_STATE```
3. Copy the ***AUTH_CODE*** (without the “code=” prefix, and the session_state parameter) and paste it in your instance configuration under the **Authorization code** parameter. 
4. Enter your client ID in the ***ID*** parameter. 
5. Enter your client secret in the ***Key*** parameter.
6. Enter your tenant ID in the ***Token*** parameter.
7. Enter your redirect URI in the ***Redirect URI*** parameter.


## Authorize Cortex XSOAR for Azure Log Analytics (client-credentials configuration)

Follow these steps for client-credentials configuration.

1. In the instance configuration, select the ***client-credentials*** checkbox.
2. Enter your Client ID in the ***ID/Client ID*** parameter. 
3. Enter your Client Secret in the ***password*** parameter.
4. Enter your Tenant ID in the ***Tenant ID*** parameter.
5. Run the ***azure-log-analytics-test*** command to test the connection and the authorization process.

## Get the additional instance parameters

To get the ***Subscription ID***, ***Workspace Name***, ***Workspace ID*** and ***Resource Group*** parameters, navigate in the Azure Portal to ***Log Analytics workspaces > YOUR-WORKSPACE > Settings*** and click on ***Workspace Settings*** tab.
