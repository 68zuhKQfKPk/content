Syncs a single incident between Cortex XSOAR and Cortex XDR. This script always uses the ***xdr-get-incident-extra-data*** command and outputs to the context the entire incident JSON. When the incident is updated in Cortex XDR, the Cortex XSOAR incident will be updated accordingly and the default playbook will rerun. When an incident is updated in Cortex XSOAR, the script will execute the ***xdr-update-incident*** command and update the incident in Cortex XDR.
